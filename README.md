## 🚀 **Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed:  

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+  
- Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA  
- Python 3.x & Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn & TensorFlow  
- Gradle  
- Git  

### **Installation**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minerva-devs/Java-Android-DataScience-Portfolio.git
cd Java-Android-DataScience-Portfolio
```
Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Android Studio**, or **Jupyter Notebook**, depending on the project type.  

### ⚙️ **Configuration**  
Some projects may require additional configurations:  
- API keys or environment variables should be placed in a `.env` file or configured within the project settings.  
- Database setup instructions are included in relevant project folders.  

## ⚙️ **Architecture Overview**  

### 🏗️ **Clean Architecture in Java & Android**  
This repository follows Clean Architecture, ensuring:  
- **Separation of concerns** – Business logic remains independent of frameworks.  
- **Scalability** – Easy to extend and modify without affecting core functionality.  
- **Testability** – Decoupled layers make unit testing more effective.  

### 📱 **MVVM (Google’s Modern Approach)**  
For Android projects, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is used to:  
- **Decouple UI logic from business logic** using ViewModel.  
- **Improve data handling** with LiveData and Repository patterns.  
- **Enhance maintainability** by structuring components efficiently.  

### 📊 **Machine Learning Workflow**  
For data science projects, the repository follows best practices in ML development, including:  
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Cleaning and transforming data for model training.  
- **Model Selection & Optimization** – Using tree-based regression, neural networks, and classification models.  
- **Evaluation & Deployment** – Assessing model performance and integrating results into applications.  

## 🧪 **Testing**  
Run tests using:  
```bash
./gradlew test  # For Java/Android projects
```
For Python & ML projects:  
```bash
pytest  # Run unit tests
jupyter notebook  # Open notebooks for interactive analysis
```

## 🛣️ **Roadmap**  
Planned improvements:  
- Enhance UI for ongoing Android projects.
